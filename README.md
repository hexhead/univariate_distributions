# Statistics Done the Hard Way

Univariate distribution is a dispersal type of a single random variable described either with a probability mass function (pmf) for discrete probability distribution, or probability density function (pdf) for continuous probability distribution.

In statistics, a univariate distribution is a probability distribution of only one random variable. This repository contains a collection of basic R codes that implement univariate distributions. I mostly grabbed the math from Wikipedia articles and Wolfram's language reference web pages. I did this the hard way to learn the mathematical basis for statistics I've done like a robot for years. Not guranteed to work correctly, but that is one of the main ideas: to verify code with resorting to R's built-in functions for statistical distributions.
