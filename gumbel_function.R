# 
# The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891â€“1966), 
# based on his original papers describing the distribution.
# 
# also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential 
# distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to 
# the Laplace distribution)
# 
# related to the Gompertz distribution
#
# Parameters:
# x_s - vector of numerics to evaluate (x values)
# b_s - vector of numerics - beta - scale (pos real)
# m_s - vector of numerics - mu - location (real)
