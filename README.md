# Statistics Done the Hard Way
 
In statistics, a univariate distribution is a probability distribution of only one random variable. This repository contains a collection of basic R codes that implement univariate distributions. I mostly grabbed the math from Wikipedia articles and Wolfram's language reference web pages. I did this the hard way to learn the mathematical basis for statistics I've done like a robot for years. Not guranteed to work correctly, but that is one of the main ideas: to verify code with resorting to R's built-in functions for statistical distributions.
