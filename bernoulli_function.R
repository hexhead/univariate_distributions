# bernoulli_function.R - Bill White - 1/28/19

# this function performs one Bernoulli trial at the probability specified
# the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes 
# the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability q=1-p, 
# that is, the probability distribution of any single experiment that asks a
# yesâ€“no question; the question results in a boolean-valued outcome, a single 
# bit of information whose value is success/yes/true/one with probability p and 
# failure/no/false/zero with probability q.
