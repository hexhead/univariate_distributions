# 
# The Burr Type XII distribution or simply the Burr distribution[1] is a 
# continuous probability distribution for a non-negative random variable. It 
# is also known as the Singhâ€“Maddala distribution[2] and is one of a number of 
# different distributions sometimes called the "generalized log-logistic 
# distribution". It is most commonly used to model household income.
# 
# Note when c = 1, the Burr distribution becomes the Pareto Type II (Lomax) 
# distribution. When k = 1, the Burr distribution is a special case of the 
# Champernowne distribution, often referred to as the Fisk distribution.
# 
# The Burr Type XII distribution is a member of a system of continuous 
# distributions introduced by Irving W. Burr (1942), which comprises 12 
# distributions.
# 
# Parameters: 
# x_s - vector of numerics to evaluate (x values) - > 0
# c_s - vector of numerics - real > 0
# k_s - vector of numerics - real > 0
